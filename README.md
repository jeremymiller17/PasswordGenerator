# PasswordGenerator

**About:**
 
 This a quick and easy password generator to run on the command line. By default it generates a password 20 chars long, including symbols, and uppercase letters. However command line arguments may be passed to edit these paramters based on user preference. This application comes with the added features of reading/writing passwords into .jpg images.
  
  *Storing or writing down your passwords in any form is not a safe practice. But if you must, atleast try and hide it... :)*
